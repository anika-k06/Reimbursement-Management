# 💸 Reimbursement Management System

A Flask web app that automates employee expense reimbursement with multi-level approval workflows. Built in 8 hours by a team of 4.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Companies struggle with manual reimbursement processes — slow approvals, no transparency, and error-prone currency conversions. This system solves that with a structured, role-based approval platform.

---

## ✅ Features

- **Employees** — Submit expenses in any currency, track approval status in real time
- **Managers** — View pending approval queue, approve/reject with comments
- **Admins** — Manage users, configure approval rules, override any expense

---

## 🧠 Approval Engine

Supports 4 rule types:

| Rule Type | Behaviour |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Sequential** | Approvers act in order. All must approve. |
| **Percentage** | X% of approvers must approve. |
| **Specific** | One designated approver's approval auto-approves the expense. |
| **Hybrid** | Specific approver OR percentage threshold — whichever comes first. |

Optionally, an employee's direct manager can be set as a **Step 0 pre-approver** before the main chain runs.
